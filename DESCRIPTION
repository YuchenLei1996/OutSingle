Description: 
    This package is used for detecting outliers from RNA Sequencing data using SVD decomposition and OPT algorithm. Use the fast_zscore_estimation function to run a gene count .tsv file to get an original z score for the read count. Then run this z score file using optht_svd_zs function and get the final outlier score (zs file) and p_value (pv file). Basically, read count with smaller p_values indicate higher probability to be an outlier.
